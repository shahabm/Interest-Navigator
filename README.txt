Interest Navigator is written as a tool for evaluating loans, annuities, savings and investments. 

It is a stand-alone web page and as such it can be deployed without a web server. It is installed by copying the files to a folder inside of the target device, while maintain the directory structure, and then creating a bookmark to the main page (in.html).  

The date picker built into Interest Navigator is derived – with minimal changes, from one written by Chris Hulbert (MIT License). At the time of this writing (September 2018) the original can be found at http://www.splinter.com.au/javascript-date-picker-that-doesnt-sucktm/.

You may host and or distribute Interest Navigator only if this disclaimer is included and made prominent to the end user.
