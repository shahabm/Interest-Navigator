# Interest-Navigator
Interest Navigator is written as a tool for evaluating loans, annuities, savings and investments. 

It is a stand-alone web site and as such it can be deployed without a web server. It is installed by copying the files or unpacking the latest zip file to a folder inside of the target device, while maintain the directory structure, and then creating a bookmark to the main page (in.html).
